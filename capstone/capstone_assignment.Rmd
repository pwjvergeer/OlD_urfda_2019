```

## Capstone definition

 - A coping stone :coping
 - The high point :crowning achievement

"..the capstone of her career.."

```{r, out.width="300px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = file.path(root, "images", "keystone.gif"))
```

## Capstone in this course

 - A showcase that you've learned how to use R in _every_ element of the data cycle
 - No statistical analysis
 - Focus on read, clean and explore data
 - Final product: An \*.Rmd (and corresponding rendered \*.html) file with your analysis sent to me by email **BEFORE** the deadline.
 
## Practical aspects
 
 - Deadline 2 February 23:59 hrs., 2018
 - Use this presentation-file "./capstone/capstone_assignment" to make the assignment
 - Questions by email, and face-to-face by appointment only (tutor-slots)
 - Work in pairs, explain your code to each-other, discuss steps you made, integrate you work in one analysis document
 
# The data
 - `Toxcast`
 - `US Airpollution`
 - `Predict molecular properties`  
 - Or your data from your minor-project
 
Choose one of the datasets below

## Toxcast data

Difficulty: **

 - Toxcast dataset in the folder "./capstone/data/toxcast"
 

## Online, open dataset 1: "US air pollution"

Difficulty: **

 - https://www.kaggle.com/sogun3/uspollution
 - The data for this dataset are in "./capstone/data/uspollution"

## Online, open dataset 2: "predicting molecular properties"

 - If you choose this, you can get the data by a download link: https://www.kaggle.com/burakhmmtgl/predict-molecular-properties/downloads/predict-molecular-properties.zip (due to the big size of the file)

Difficulty: ***

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(jsonlite)
file_json <- file.path(root, "capstone", "data", "predictmolprop", "pubChem_p_00000001_00025000.json")
example <- fromJSON(file_json, flatten=TRUE)
example$atoms[[1]]
```

## Your own data; prerequisites

 - Quantitative data
 - At least three factor (grouping) variables
 - At least three different treatments
 - At least 200 rows of raw data

_Sent an example to me, I will grade the difficulty and approve/disapprove the dataset._

# The assignment

## Introduction
Write a short (max 300 words) introduction that explains some of the details of the data you are analyzing for your capstone assignment

 - The type of data
 - The 'experiment' or variables
 - The source of the data
 - The anticipated results or aim of the analysis: Which (research) question is being addressed
 
## Reading data into R

 - Import the data into R with a code-chunk 
 - If zipped unzip the data with R before loading
 - User `relative` paths so that your code is portable
 
## Inspect the integrity of the data

 - Write a code chunk that checks the data, number of rows, number of variables, names of the variables, data-type of the variable 
 - Create a summary statistics of each variable that shows confidence intervals, max, min, mean, median values
 - Create code that asserts the data-type of each variable
 
## Tidy data

 - Write a code chunk that creates a tidy dataframe:
  * Each variable in it's own column (long format)
  * Each row has it's own observation
  * Each value has it's own cell
  * Variable names are all lowercase and snake_case and have a short descriptive name
 - Reshape the data if necessary
 
## Select, Filter, Mutate, Summarize

 - Select proper variables
 - Filter values if needed
 - Create new variables with `dplyr::mutate()` if needed
 - Summarize the data by grouping variables and calculate mean values
 
## Exploratory data analysis
Create at least four (4) graphs that show some sort of relationship between variables present in the data

**For example:**

 - Use colours to isolate groups in the data
 - Use facets to show groups in the data
 - Use diffrent types of graphs (e.g. `geom_point`, `geom_line`, `geom_bar`, `scale_fille_gradient` )
 - Provide a graph that indicates information on the distribution of your data
 
## Graph criteria

 - The graph has a descriptive title
 - The axes have units and decriptive _short_ titles
 - The graph is visually appealing and the scale is correct
 
## Results

 - Write a short paragraph (max 500 words) on your resulting graphs.
 - What does the reader have to take away from the graphs you've shown?

**_Tell a data-story!_**

## Conclusion

 - Refer to the introduction and write a short (max 200 words) conclusion on you analysis  - Identify gaps in you analysis
 - What still needs to be done? / What is lacking?
