```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Demo's and tutorials
 - Are great resources to learn R
 - Sometimes they use the best practices
 - Sometimes they clearly do not
 
## Four things you will have to forget (or ignore)
I will provide a good, programming-sound, alternative

 1. Please do not use `setwd()`
 2. Please do not attach anything with the `attach()` function
 3. Please do not use the `=` (equal to) assignment when creating variables
 4. Please do not use the `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` `in read.csv()`, use `readr::read_...()` functions instead
 
## Setting the working directory with setwd() 
The `setwd()` function sets the working dierectory to the current directory. I will show you why not to use this.


```{r}
name <- "marc"
dir.create(name)


```
