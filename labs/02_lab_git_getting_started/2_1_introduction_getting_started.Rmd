```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3)
```

```{r, root_1, include=FALSE}
## defines the root of the project for later use
require("rprojroot") || utils::install.packages("rprojroot")
library(rprojroot)
root <- find_root_file(criterion = is_rstudio_project)
```

## R is Case sensitive

*_Important note: R is case-sensitive, meaning that it will matter whether you use capital or lower case, keep this in mind if you get a cryptic warning or error!_*

## Cloud server for RStudio

 - Preinstalled version of the R-IDE (integrated development environment) RStudio
 - Runs on a remote server and has all the add-ons that are needed to run the code. 
 - Login with the credentials supplied at the beginning of the course. 

To login to this server:

 https://urfda.hudatascience.nl


## RStudio interface
```{r fig.width=10,echo=FALSE}
library(png)
library(grid)
img_rstudio <- readPNG(source = paste0(root, "/images/1a_rstudio_interface.png"))
 grid.raster(img_rstudio)
```


## Setting up package repositories
- Default RStudio has only enabled the CRAN repository, but there are other useful repositories that contain nice R packages. 
- Enable the Bioconductor repositories (located at http://www.bioconductor.org) as packages from these repositories are often used in molecular biology. 
- We only need to do this once, so the next time you start Rstudio it remembers which repositories are enabled. 
- Type in the Console window (not the R script window!) the following command: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
setRepositories(graphics=TRUE)
```

## Cloning the course materials from Github.com
This step starts a new project in RStudio with contents from a Github repository.

 1. Create an account on www.github.com
 2. Login in to github.com and go to 
 www.github.com/uashogeschoolutrecht/urfda_2019
 3. Copy the _url_ address
 4. Start a new project in RStudio-Server, 
 choose _"Version Control"_
 5. Copy the 'clone' link in the 'url' field, press enter
 6. Let the clone finish
 
**Follow the steps above first before continuing**

Did it work? Please let me know if not.

## About this document: Literate programming

 - This document is an R-markdown document. 
 - To create documents containing normal text, code and output of that code together. 
 - So-called _"Literate Programming"_
 - Part of the "Reproducible research" philosophy.
 - R Markdown can also include and interpret LaTeX, which is used much in the technical fields. 
 - It can render formulas's as well
 
## Example formula in LaTeX
 
 Working_with_R = $\sqrt[root](absolute(\frac{Participants\;fun}{much\;persistence}))$

## Where do my files live?
 - The root of a project can be defined by:
```{r} 
 
if (!require("rprojroot")) install.packages("rprojroot")
library(rprojroot)
root <- find_root_file(criterion = is_rstudio_project)
root
``` 
 
To see what the current working directory is, you can execute the command

`getwd()` 

in the Console window. Try it now!

If all went well the latter half of the working directory will state "/r_course"

## Creating a new R script
 - Start by creating an R script file that will contain all the steps taken to get to a certain result. 
 - Initially a scrapbook to note down what exactly you did. 
 - Annotate scripts with `# Comments`
 - During this course, we will create a special R script file (`.Rmd`) for every exercise that contains the steps of that particular exercise (for instance a file named `"exercise_intro_to_r_exercise.Rmd"`). 

## How to run the code in RStudio

This document contains code chunks:
```{r, eval=FALSE} 
# a code chunk begins with ```{r}
y <- rnorm(100)
x <- sum(y)
x
hist(y)
# and ends with ```
``` 

## Running your first R-code
These so called code chunks contain R code that does something: 

For example: calculate the mean of a number of random normal numbers. 
Without running the code, can you guess what the mean will approximately be?
Why is it not eaxactly 10?
```{r, results='hide'}
set.seed(12345)
random <- rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 10, sd = 1.5)
mean(random)
hist(random, breaks = 80)
```
_*Try adjusting the `n = 100` and the `breaks` arguments, to a larger or smaller number*_

## Run the code chunks as follows:
place the cursor somewhere in a code chunk and between the 
` ```{r} ` and the ` ``` ` and press the keys: 

`Ctrl` `Shift` and `Enter` simultaneously. 

The code will run and the results will show either in the console, or below the code chunk. 

## Run a line of code as follows:

 - Place the cursor somewhere on the line that you want to run.
 - Press the keys:

`Cntrl` and `Enter` simultaneously.

You can also run a piece of code by selecting the code by dragging the cursor and left-click mouse, and entering:

`Cntrl` and `Enter` simultaneously.
